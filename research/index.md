# <i class="fas fa-microscope"></i>Research

Early stages in modern drug discovery often involve screening small molecules for their effects on a selected protein 
target or a model of a biological pathway. In the past fifteen years, innovative technologies that enable rapid 
synthesis and high throughput screening of large libraries of compounds have been adopted in almost all major 
pharmaceutical and biotech companies and have also proliferated to academia leading to the unprecedented growth of 
available databases of biologically active compounds. Managing, understanding, analyzing and exploiting this data to 
enable rational design of new experiments requires skills and computational tools.

Tropshaâ€™s Laboratory for Molecular Modeling conducts studies in the broad areas of computer-assisted drug design, 
cheminformatics and structural bioinformatics. The lab is generally interested in understanding the relationship 
between biomolecular structure and its function.

The lab is poised to develop

* novel descriptors to characterize complex molecules, 
* novel structural and ligand based techniques for virtual screening chemical libraries for interesting compounds, 
* novel biologically relevant diversity/similarity measures, 
* novel tools for the design of novel compound with high expected hit rates, and 
* novel protocols for large scale cheminformatics computing and dissemination of such tools
