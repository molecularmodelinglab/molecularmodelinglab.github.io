Student have also joined in the past from the [Biological and Biomedical Science Program](https://bbsp.unc.edu/prospective-students/welcome-from-the-dean/)
and from the [PhD in Computer Science Program](https://cs.unc.edu/graduate/phd/). We have accepted other students from a variety of other programs as well; reach out
to your graduate coordinator and Alex with questions regarding your specific program. 

If you have not yet joined one of the PhD programs above, the first step to joining our group is to apply and be admitted to one of these programs.
If you are already a PhD student in one of the above programs and are interested in rotating in our lab, please [contact Alex](https://pharmacy.unc.edu/directory/tropsha/) to set up a time to discuss your interest.

### Undergraduate Students

We welcome undergraduate students into our lab.
Undergraduate researchers have become first authors on papers submitted on research that they performed as part of our group.
We are happy to train undergraduates in many aspects of data-driven drug discovery and cheminformatics.

If you are an undergraduate interested in discussing research opportunities please [contact Alex](https://pharmacy.unc.edu/directory/tropsha/).
