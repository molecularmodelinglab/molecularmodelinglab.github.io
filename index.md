# Supporting Drug Discovery with Data Science

The Molecular Modeling Lab (MML) at UNC Chapel Hill Eshelman School of Pharmacy works at the interface of 
pharmaceutical and data science to happen accelerate the discovery of novel drugs. Our focus is split between 
development of open source, innovative computational methods and applications of such methods in tangible discovery 
campaigns.

We use machine learning and datascience to investigate the relationship between chemicals and their various biological
activities. We strive to not just make advancements in methodology, but to development robust workflows for using these
tools.

Tools are useless if no one can use them. All of our tools and code is freely available for anyone to utilize and build
upon. Further, many have easy to use web interfaces to make them more accessible to the public.
