I study the role of mice in pharmaceutical science, specifically their role in toxicity assessment. My focus is on minimizing the number of mice that need to be used as animal models.
I also serve as the lab enforcer. Step out of line, and Huxley knows about it. Most lab members have never met me, and if they are lucky it will stay that way.

In my spare time I enjoy tearing up carpets and complaining about my 8pm meal time.
