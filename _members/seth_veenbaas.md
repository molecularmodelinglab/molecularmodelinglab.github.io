My work is focused on improving the accuracy of machine learning tools for
making “out-of-domain” predictions in the cheminformatics applications, 
such as ultra-large datasets generated from screening DNA-encoded 
libraries.

I enjoy mixology, skiing, woodworking, ceramics, and anything that requires
tools.
