My work focuses on methods and applications for utilizing ultra large
chemical libraries to discover chemical leads for understudied targets.
These methods incorporate molecular mechanics, quantum mechanics and 
machine learning to help inch towards a reliable and trustworthy
binding affinity prediction

I also sew costumes for my pet plastic goose, Goose Springsteen (pictured above).
Email me recommendations I might just make them. I also like cheese
