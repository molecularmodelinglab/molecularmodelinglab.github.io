Hi! My name is Zoe Sessions. Thanks for checking out my profile!
In the spirit of not really liking to talk about myself, here are three brief highlights that may interest you:

1) I am from a small town in CT, did my undergrad at UNC-Chapel Hill (Class of 2022), and am pursuing my PhD in Pharmacology at UPenn. Outside of work, I am a music junkie, sports enthusiast, and lover of the outdoors.

2) Most of my experience has been focused on in silico methods of drug discovery. As for wet lab experience, my B.S. in Chemistry exposed me to many different laboratory techniques, in addition to a bench research position in a biology lab. That said, my primary focus thus far has been on techniques like Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling and all things data science.

3) In terms of interpersonal skills, I am a big communicator. I love working in a team and value the different perspectives and approaches individuals can bring to a group environment. Respect for your colleagues is everything! That said, I also really value environments conducive to both collaboration and individual work. Having space to process and work individually is what I believe aids in the development of individual perspectives.
