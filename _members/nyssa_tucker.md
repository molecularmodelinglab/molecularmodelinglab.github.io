Nyssa Tucker is their third year pursuing a PhD in the Biological and Biomedical Sciences Program at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) within the Curriculum of Toxicology and Environmental Medicine. Nyssa graduated cum laude with bachelorâ€™s degrees in Biology and Chemistry from Meredith College. There, they gained research experience in antibiotic synthetic chemistry and ethics. In 2018, Nyssa began a fellowship under the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) program as a researcher at the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) in laboratory of Dr. Brian Chorley. At EPA, Nyssa established and validated an in vitro model of an hepatic steatosis that helped quantify the impact of this condition to liver susceptibility upon environmental chemical exposure. As a graduate student at UNC-CH circa 2021, Nyssa uses chemoinformatic tools to model hepatic steatosis causing compounds and identify molecules of concern in the lab of Dr. Alex Tropsha. Embedded within these divergent research interests is the drive to better understand foundational mechanisms leading to outcome disparities.
