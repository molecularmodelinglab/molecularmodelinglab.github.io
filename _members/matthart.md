My research sits at the intersection of materials science, chemistry, and data science. I primarily focus on using emerging methods in materials informatics to aid in the experimental discovery of catalytic and polymeric materials. My other work includes the development of active machine learning methods for the development of automated laboratory systems.

The pursuit of science not only results in life-changing technology, it also presents us with the opportunity to foster fruitful relationships on an international level. Realizing this, I feel a strong call to engage in international scientific collaboration and science-based diplomacy. I currently have research experience in three countries, and am always looking to further expand my international scientific experience.
With passions for science, philosophy, music, and language exchange; I take a deeply interdisciplinary approach to solving problems both big and small.
