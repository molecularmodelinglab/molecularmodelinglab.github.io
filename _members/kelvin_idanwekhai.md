Kelvin studied Industrial Chemistry at Obafemi Awolowo University, Nigeria. After that, he worked as a freelance ML engineer/developer and briefly worked with a few startups. One day he had an epiphany and decided to apply to graduate school. Heâ€™s currently a 1st-year student in the lab and spends his time building models and writing software for chem/bio(informatics).

Outside the lab, Kelvin romanticizes becoming a writer and writes long essays, which he occasionally posts on his blog. He listens to Audio Book versions of Haruki Murakami daily while walking and moonlights as an armchair philosopher in the evening.
