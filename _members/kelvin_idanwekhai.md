Kelvin studied Industrial Chemistry at Obafemi Awolowo University, Nigeria. After that, he worked as a freelance ML engineer/developer and briefly worked with a few startups. One day he had an epiphany and applied to graduate school. Heâ€™s currently a 2nd-year student in the lab. He spends his time building models, writing software for chem/bio(informatics), and researching methods that optimize processes for chemical and biological discovery.

Outside the lab, Kelvin romanticizes becoming a writer. He writes essays which he occasionally posts on his blog. He listens to audiobooks while walking daily and moonlights as an armchair philosopher in the evening.
