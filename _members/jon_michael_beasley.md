I graduated from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in May 2020 with a Bachelor's degree in Biochemistry. I joined the MML in Spring 2021 for my PhD in the CBMC division of the Eshelman School of Pharmacy. 

My research focuses on the use of highly connected, diverse biochemical and biomedical data in knowledge graphs to drive biomarker identification, target nomination, and drug repurposing. Other research efforts include data-driven target discovery by systems pharmacology analyses of proteomics, RNAseq, and CRISPR genetic knockout data.

Recently got in to brewing kombucha. Message me if you want a free kombucha starter culture of your own!
